<h1>Cinema Scope</h1>
<p>Cinema Scope is a Flutter app that uses the TMDB API to provide movie and TV listings.

The app provides detailed information on each title, including trailers, images, overviews, ratings, release dates, genres, cast and crew, recommendations, keywords, runtime, more titles by the director/creator, more titles by the leading actors, similar titles, and much more. The person detail page provides images, personal details, filmography, alternative names, and useful filters to short-list the filmography.
